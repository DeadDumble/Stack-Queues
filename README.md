# Stack-Queues
stack queue project

This project was developed to compare the efficiency of stack and queue implementations using different types of linked lists.

This project provides two separate implementations of Stack and Queue data structures in C++:

Doubly Linked List Implementation (stack_queue_dll)

Singly Linked List Implementation (stack_queue_ll)

Each implementation includes source files (.cpp and .h), as well as precompiled executables (.exe).

Features

Both implementations support the following operations:

Stack Operations:

Push

Pop

Peek

Queue Operations:

Enqueue

Dequeue

Peek

Project Structure

stack_queue_dll (Doubly Linked List Implementation)

maindll.cpp - Main driver program that tests stack and queue functionality.

maindll.exe - Executable file for the compiled program.

sqdll.cpp - Implementation of stack and queue operations using a doubly linked list.

sqdll.h - Header file defining stack and queue structures and functions.

stack_queue_ll (Singly Linked List Implementation)

mainll.cpp - Main driver program that tests stack and queue functionality.

mainll.exe - Executable file for the compiled program.

sqll.cpp - Implementation of stack and queue operations using a singly linked list.

sqll.h - Header file defining stack and queue structures and functions.
